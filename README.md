Pyramid Apex Games - Sprite Utility

A simple application that in its current state can be used to swap the colors of an image(Using, internally created palettes.)

Todo:
1. Clean up the code here and there so that functions are in the proper Node/Scene file.
2. Area specific swapping. (Allow thus for a person to select an area.)
3. Batch specific mapping. (Allow thus for a list of actions such as(select-area, swap colors, export file, import file.)
4. Add an import/export palette functionality. (With the notion there may be different palette formats one wishes to use.)
